## About Me 
An ordinary Belarusian guy who wants to become a good IT specialist. Graduated from BNTU and I have a higher education in the specialty of an electrical engineer. I hope my engineering mindset will help me in mastering the IT sphere. By myself, I am very kind, the soul of the company and I joke a lot. I am diligent and do not give up work halfway, although sometimes I am short-tempered. I'm going to the goal and I don't see any obstacles.
